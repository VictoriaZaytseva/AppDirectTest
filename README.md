# AppDirectTest

Welcome to the Unfinshed App Direct Integration Test App!(and my first Java Spring App :/)
Instalation:
1. In servlet file add the path to your database
2. mvn package will create a .war file
3. drop it in the tomcat folder
4. you can send it mock requests with the data from AppDirect api and test it
I tested it with https://www.mockable.io/
What it does:
Create and cancel subscription!
What is planned:
1. Add oAuth
2. Add more checks for database queries
3. Really add more checks
4. Assign and unassign users
5. Maybe try Hibernate or other database mapping thingy, I was interested to do it manually for the 
first time
6. And, for the love of god, do normal error messages
